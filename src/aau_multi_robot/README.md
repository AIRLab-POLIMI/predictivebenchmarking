This includes the autonomous multi-robot system developed at the <a
href="http://nes.aau.at">Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems</a> at <a
href="http://www.aau.at">Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt</a>.

The system operates completely 
<ul>
    <li><strong>autonomously</strong>, i.e., robots explore without intervention of humans a given area and return to the original starting position having completed the exploration</li>
    <li><strong>independent</strong>, i.e., robots do not rely on preexisting infrastructure but set up their own ad-hoc network</li>
    <li><strong>coordinated</strong>, i.e., before assigning new frontiers to explore, robots coordinate each other to prevent redundant exploration of areas</li>
    <li><strong>self-organized</strong>, i.e., no central entity control the system
</ul>

Try it out yourself using <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>. We've test the system on Pioneer 3-DX and turtlebots in various environments.
