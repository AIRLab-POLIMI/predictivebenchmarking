	//****************Create the Generalized Voronoi-Diagram**********************
	//This function takes a given map and segments it with the generalized Voronoi-Diagram. It takes following steps:
	//	I. It calculates the generalized Voronoi-Diagram using the function createVoronoiGraph.
	//	II. It extracts the critical points, which show the border between two segments. This part takes these steps:
	//		1. Extract node-points of the Voronoi-Diagram, which have at least 3 neighbors.
	//		2. Reduce the leave-nodes (Point on graph with only one neighbor) of the graph until the reduction
	//		   hits a node-Point. This is done to reduce the lines along the real voronoi-graph, coming from the discretisation
	//		   of the contour.
	//		3. Find the critical points in the reduced graph by searching in a specified neighborhood for a local minimum
	//		   in distance to the nearest black pixel. The size of the epsilon-neighborhood is dynamic and goes larger
	//		   in small areas, so they are split into lesser regions.
	//	III. It gets the critical lines, which go from the critical point to its two nearest black pixels and separate the
	//		 regions from each other. This part does following steps:
	//			1. Get the discretized contours of the map and the holes, because these are the possible candidates for
	//			   basis-points.
	//			2. Find the basis-points for each critical-point by finding the two nearest neighbors of the vector from 1.
	//			   Also it saves the angle between the two vectors pointing from the critical-point to its two basis-points.
	//			3. Some critical-lines are too close to each other, so the next part eliminates some of them. For this the
	//			   algorithm checks, which critical points are too close to each other. Then it compares the angles of these
	//			   points, which were calculated in 3., and takes the one with the larger angle, because smaller angles
	//			   (like 90 degree) are more likely to be at edges of the map or are too close to the borders. If they have
	//			   the same angle, the point which comes first in the critical-point-vector is chosen (took good results for
	//			   me, but is only subjective).
	//			4. Draw the critical lines, selected by 3. in the map with color 0.
	//	IV. It finds the segments, which are seperated by the critical lines of III. and fills them with a random colour that
	//		hasn't been already used yet. For this it:
	//			1. It erodes the map with critical lines, so small gaps are closed, and finds the contours of the segments.
	//			   Only contours that are large/small enough are chosen to be drawn.
	//			2. It draws the contours from 1. in a map with a random colour. Contours that belong to holes are not drawn
	//			   into the map.
	//			3. Spread the colour-regions to the last white Pixels, using the watershed-region-spreading function.
